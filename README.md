# An uprising Web Developer
( Yea that's me! )
### Hey!

I'm Ayes, an web-developer whose dream it is to
once be a full-time fullstack-developer for a company, either big or small.

Currently working on an app called Calendarium which is supposed to be used as an appointment planner for groups with the sizes of 5-15 people.
People can sign up for your appointments and un-sign if they have to, so you always know who's going to fill a place and who's not.

Oh, I also sometimes do music but haven't really been posting it! 8+
years of FL Studio experience here~

Anyway! If you would like to support me on my journey to become a
full-time web developer don't hesitate to hit me up 
:D

#### Greetings Ayes ~
