# An uprising Game Developer
( Yea that's me! )
### Hey!

I'm Ayes, an unreal engine game developer whose dream it is to
once be a full-time game developer for a studio, either big or small.

Currently working on a top-down game called Ambience where you're supposed to
find your way through a labyrinth filled with deadly threats.
The catch is however that you can't directly see any walls or threats.
You've been given tools to overcome this hurdle however. Would you
manage to make your way through all the levels?

Oh, I also sometimes do music but haven't really been posting it! 8+
years of FL Studio experience here~

Anyway! If you would like to support me on my journey to become a
full-time game developer don't hesitate to hit me up 
:D

#### Greetings Ayes ~
